Linux Hacker Suite
Overview
Linux Hacker Suite is a comprehensive, all-in-one application designed for beginners to learn and execute ethical hacking techniques on Linux. The suite integrates multiple tools and utilities—ranging from network scanning and vulnerability analysis to terminal emulation and real-time command execution—all wrapped in a modern, lightweight GUI.

Features
Modular Interface: Easily switch between modules (e.g., network scanner, vulnerability assessor, password auditor).

Integrated Terminal Emulator: Execute Linux commands, run scripts, and view real-time output.

Network Analysis: Tools for port scanning, packet sniffing, and traffic monitoring.

Vulnerability Scanner: Automated checks for common security issues.

Ethical Hacking Tutorials: Guided walkthroughs for performing basic security assessments.

Real-Time Alerts & Logs: Monitor activity and get notifications of potential vulnerabilities.

User-Friendly Dashboard: Clean, intuitive UI aimed at beginners.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) embedded in Tauri or similar lightweight framework.

Backend: Rust-powered APIs for performance and security; Node.js for handling command execution.

Terminal Integration: Xterm.js (or similar) for embedding a full-featured terminal emulator.

Additional Tools: Integration with common Linux utilities and open-source ethical hacking tools.
